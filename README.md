To set up a RabbitMQ environment using Docker Compose and define queues, you can follow these steps:

1. Follow a file created named `docker-compose.yml` and open it for editing.

2. Check the following contents to the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3.8.17-management
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"
      - "15672:15672"
    volumes:
      - ./definitions.json:/etc/rabbitmq/definitions.json
    environment:
      - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=admin
      - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=admin
    networks:
      - rabbitmq-network

networks:
  rabbitmq-network:
    driver: bridge
```

3. Create a file named `definitions.json` and open it for editing.

4. Add the following contents to the `definitions.json` file to define the queues:

```json
{
  "queues": [
    {
      "name": "temperature_queue",
      "vhost": "/",
      "auto_delete": false
    },
    {
      "name": "humidity_queue",
      "vhost": "/",
      "auto_delete": false
    }
  ]
}
```

5. Save both files (`docker-compose.yml` and `definitions.json`) in the same directory.

6. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are saved.

7. Run the following command to start the RabbitMQ containers:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start the RabbitMQ container with management interface accessible at `http://localhost:15672` (username: `admin`, password: `admin`).

8. You can now use the netcat commands mentioned earlier to send data to the respective queues:

For temperature:

```
echo "sensor_id=h1; value=40" | nc -u localhost 3344
```

For humidity:

```
echo "sensor_id=h1; value=60" | nc -u localhost 3355
```

The data will be sent to the corresponding queues (`temperature_queue` and `humidity_queue`) in RabbitMQ.

Remember to adjust the commands and configuration as needed.
